# Nami-Simulator
A MBD and Beam based simulator based on the Project Chrono physics engine. The goal of this project is to build a tool to better characterize the loads on the main steering shaft of the Nami Burn E scooter and better understand the catastrophic failure mode in which the shaft can fracture.

It is suspected that the AL 7075 steering shaft present in all Nami Burn E scooters manufactured before Jan. 2023 are seeing stress from normal use which eventually exceed the typical fatigue limit for aluminum 7075. Several scooters have failed suddenly and catastrophically due to this suspected design oversight.

Anectotal cases can be found in the following Facebook post: https://www.facebook.com/groups/namiworldwide/posts/1246539072876878/
